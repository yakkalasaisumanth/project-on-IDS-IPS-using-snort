# Project on IDS & IPS.

# IDS(Intrusion Detection System).

- An intrusion detection system (IDS) refers to a network security software or device to identify malicious activities and threats and alerts and logs them.

- Features of IDS.
   - Alerts(Detects)
   - Log(event tracker)

- We often listen NIDS & HIDS Means NIDS(Network Intrusion Detection System) which monitors the entire network including the subnets also. HIDS(Host Intrusion Detection System). which monitors only the Hosts or it traffics the network on single end point.

- the features of the NIDS & HIDS are the same as IDS.

# Intrusion Prevention System(IPS).

- An intrusion prevention system (IPS) refers to a network security software or device to identify malicious activities and threats and prevent them.Since it works for both detection and prevention, itâ€™s also called the Identity Detection and Prevention System (IDPS).

- Features of IPS.
   - Alerts(Detects)
   - Log(Event tracker)
   - Drop(Detected packet)
   - Rejects(Entire Traffic)

- We often listen NIDS & HIDS Means NIPS(Network Intrusion Prevention System) which monitors the entire network including the subnets also. HIpS(Host Intrusion Prevention System). which monitors only the Hosts or it traffics the network on single end point.

- the features of the NIPS & HIPS are the same as IPS.

## How IDS & IPS Works.

- there are set of **RULES**

- If the traffic pattern matches the rules then the IDS detects and alerts us.

- If the traffic pattern matches the rules then the IPS detects and alerts and also Drops Or Rejects the Traffic as prescribed by the rule.

- Type Of the rules.

 1. Signatures.

   - signatures are the rules or the technique relayed on the known malicious behavior.

   - for example antivirus, defenders,etc,.

 2. Behavior Based.

   - In this we train the software with the normal behavior and abnormal behavior. which is useful to identify the malicious traffic.

   - for example normal behavior means HTTPS, tcp, udp and abnormal behavior means like ftp, ssh, tenet, smtpd, etc,.

 3. Policy Based.
 
   -  it is a security and system configuration based.

   - windows group policy, license, etc,.

# Snort.

- it is an IDS and IPS Tool.

- it can analyses the live traffic and triggers the alerts and logs and drops and rejects lively.

- it can log packets for later analysis.

- it can sniff the packets.

- snort needs some rules to run.

1. snort config
  
  - it contains the path to rules.

  - it contains the plugins and connects them to config file.

  - it contains some variables example source net(source network) and also the external network.(any).

  - path = /etc/snort/snort.config

  - rules path = /etc/snort/local.rules

2. Snort modes
  1. sniffer mode
  2. packet logger
  3. NIDS/NIPS

## Task 5 Operation mode 1. sniffer mode.

-  this task defines the first operation mode of snort which is sniffer mode.

-  as the name sugessts this mode is used sniff the data and log the data.

- to run the sniffer mode in the snort there are some options.

1. |Parameter       |    Description |
1. |-v              | Verbose Display the TCP/IP output in the console.|
2. |-d              |Display the packet data (payload).|
3. |-e              |Display the link-layer (TCP/IP/UDP/ICMP) headers.| 
4. |-X              |Display the full packet details in HEX.|
5. |-i              |This parameter helps to define a specific network interface to listen/sniff. Once you have multiple interfaces, you can choose a specific interface to sniff. |



- Note that you can use the parameters both in combined and separated form as follows;
```
    snort -v
    snort -vd
    snort -de
    snort -v -d -e
    snort -X
